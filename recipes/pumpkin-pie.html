    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Pumpkin pie is an all-time holiday dessert classic, but maybe it's time for a glow up. 
        For Thanksgiving this year, Allrecipes challenged 5 of our favorite bakers to upgrade our <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/229932/simple-pumpkin-pie/">basic pumpkin pie recipe</a>. 
        The rules? The base ingredients needed to stay the same, and the bakers could only use five additional ingredients for their upgrade. 
        Check out the rest of the pumpkin pie recipes from our challenge, <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/longform/pumpkin-pie-your-way/">here</a>.

        As a food blogger, I can't resist adding a little showmanship to any recipe. 
        And a quick-and-easy pumpkin pie recipe is the perfect canvas, with its creamy orange-brown filling acting as a blank slate for a delicious, showstopping topping.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Pumpkin Pie</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vanilla Meringue</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>5 large egg whites</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Follow the directions for making Allrecipes' <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/229932/simple-pumpkin-pie/">Simple Pumpkin Pie</a>, then make the meringue.</li>
        <li>Place the sugar, egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in the top pan of a double boiler or in a heatproof bowl set over a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan filled with a few inches of simmering water (be sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water).</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat, using a heatproof rubber spatula to stir the mixture and scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally, until the sugar is completely melted and the candy thermometer inserted in the center of the mixture reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Immediately pour the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on low for 1 minute, then increase the speed to medium-high and whisk for 10 minutes, or until stiff, glossy peaks form and the sides of the bowl should feel cool to touch. Add the vanilla and mix on medium-low speed until combined.</li>
        <li>Use immediately by scooping the meringue over the pumpkin pie. Use a chef's torch (see foot note) to toast the meringue and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>

    <p>
        If you don't have a chef's torch, you can also broil the adorned pie in the oven for around 30 seconds to torch the meringue. 
        Just watch it like a hawk or you'll risk overdoing it!
